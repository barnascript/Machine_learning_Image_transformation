# Goals
I learnt how to apply different geometric transformations to images, like translation, rotation, affine transformation etc.
You will see these functions: cv.getPerspectiveTransform
# Transformations
OpenCV provides two transformation functions, cv.warpAffine and cv.warpPerspective, with which you can perform all kinds of transformations. cv.warpAffine takes a 2x3 transformation matrix while cv.warpPerspective takes a 3x3 transformation matrix as input.
